At these levels the orthogonal geometry of the apartment planning interfaces with the implicit curved form of the building creating the opportunity for double height balconies with exceptional views.The dramatic form created from the three overlapping floorplates provides an elegant termination to a building of such complexity.The selected finishes bring substance to the larger luxurious apartments at these levels borrowing their form and texture from, but not imitating, the architecture of the building.Designed by Herzog & de Meuron, One Park Drive is the new district's signature building. Positioned at the head of the dock, it proudly represents everything that makes the new neighbourhood so special - a unique architectural achievement thoughtfully designed to be the very best in city and waterside living.Development includes:The first residential building by Herzog & de Meuron in the UKLocated on Canary Wharf's 128 acre private EstateA full suite of residential amenities over 2 floorsOutstanding location surrounded by parks and waterwaysIncredible level of specificationTerraces to all apartmentsOne Park Drive is a single harmonious building, however its 58 storeys are made up of three typologies, each with its own distinct characteristics.The lower floors contain the Loft apartments - some of One Park Drive's largest apartments. With high ceilings and wrap-around terraces, they are designed to make the most of the connection to both the green spaces and the waterfront.The Cluster forms the heart of the building. It is the typology that contains the greatest variety of apartments. The lower levels are connected with the parks and the water, the higher floors with the sky.The upper floors contain the Bay apartments. They have double-height terraces which are set back into the building. Their design is focused on maximising light and the views across London.Every apartment has terraces designed to work seamlessly with the interior living spaces. There is also great variety; many of the Cluster apartments have two outside areas, the Lofts have expansive wrap-around terraces and the Bay apartment terraces have double-height space above them. Each terrace is naturally sheltered within the building's form, yet connected with the scenery beyond. They're spaces that invite you outside.The apartment interiors deliver a complexity and surprise that complements One Park Drive's powerful exterior form, as well as creating a sense of calm and a luxurious intimacy.The interiors focus on natural materials and finishes throughout with special attention being paid to the tactile surfaces. The three typologies so powerfully expressed in the exterior architecture have their own distinct yet harmonious personalities.One Park Drive celebrates its communal spaces. Spread across the ground and first floors, they are all fully integrated into the life of the building and positively engage with its surroundings.The reception, concierge, lounge, library and cinema are all on the ground floor. The first floor houses the exclusive health club including a 20-metre pool, gym, studio space and spa. Dramatic floor-to-ceiling glazing invites stunning views across the surrounding parks, gardens and water.Canary Wharf Group's careful stewardship of the private Canary Wharf Estate over the past 30 years has made it one of the safest, connected, best maintained and most vibrant districts in the capital. And now the most exciting evolution in the Estate's history has begun - the creation of the new residential district.It will be a neighbourhood of green spaces and waterside boardwalks. A neighbourhood that's both an oasis of calm and one of the most well connected in Europe. A neighbourhood where it will be just as easy to grab the essentials of daily life as it will be to take in live music or theatre. It will be a local neighbourhood with all the benefits of being part of a private Estate.","num_bathrooms":3,"listing_status":"sale"},{"displayable_address":"One Park Drive, Canary Wharf E14","last_published_date":{"__class__":"datetime","__value__":"2020-04-08T20:41:58"},"longitude":-0.0154863745,"image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/c32c9f00b6aa3bc06c54ea8575b48ed4c072fd98.jpg","listing_id":"54718000","agent_phone":"020 8115 5164","price":1795000.0,"country_code":"gb","agent_address":"Millennium Harbour, 22 Westferry Road, London","county":null,"details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/54718000?utm_source=v1:7OOcASeVBADarhakZaAysSPpPE0tj76B&utm_medium=api","street_name":"One Park Drive","agent_name":"CBRE","num_recepts":1,"latitude":51.50015,"category":"Residential","outcode":"E14","property_type":"Flat","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/6ca76d49b5e07076b3b7d9a3031ccc88010e8842.png"],"post_town":null,"first_published_date":{"__class__":"datetime","__value__":"2020-04-03T15:40:53"},"num_bedrooms":3,"price_modifier":null,"agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(503333).png","country":null,"description":"Live Virtual Tour available.

Ward changed the world with his botanical glass container 'the Wardian Case' and his influence can be felt throughout the building, with large glass cases of steel, glass and bronze showcasing plants from all over the world, providing an ever changing backdrop in line with the seasons. The planted environment spills out into the whole building, from the lush and verdant edges of Wardian's luxury open-air pool to the exquisite roof garden and observatory. Uniquely, the apartment also offers a fully-fledged private garden that wraps around the apartment, a rarity in such a prime central location, which can be enjoyed all year from the apartments striking floor to ceiling windows. Each garden is tailored to an individual owners taste, from lush to sleek minimalism.Located on the corner of the building upon the 46th floor, the magnificent open-plan kitchen/living area and spectacular private roof garden both enjoy a Southerly and Easterly aspect and take in breath-taking panorama of Docklands skyline. The floor-to-ceiling windows that encase the apartment not only provide an all year-round panorama but bathe the apartment in stunning natural light. The materials of wood, marble and glass used within the d\u00e9cor of the apartment mirrors that of the glass cases and the botanical life found extensively throughout the development. The two double bedrooms are beautifully proportioned and enjoy bespoke, inbuilt storage. The master suite benefits from the convenience of a stunning en-suite with roll top bath and walk in shower, with the family bathroom also enjoying a bath with shower overhead.Every resident of the Wardian benefits from membership to its first class facilities. The facilities include a cinema, 25 meter pool and gym including a spa, steam room and yoga studio, rooftop observatory and bar, private dining area, as well as a 24 hour concierge available to ensure there is always someone on hand to assist at any time of the day and night. In addition to the exclusive in-house facilities, the developments proximity to London's iconic landmarks, rail network and airports makes this the perfect location for residents who work both nationally and internationally and ensures time spent within the Wardian is always exciting.","num_bathrooms":2,"listing_status":"sale"},{"displayable_address":"Wardian, East Tower, London E14","last_published_date":{"__class__":"datetime","__value__":"2020-07-01T11:24:27"},"longitude":-0.01783,"image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/3b3f26160694356f3fac0bae8a54ec075f167705.jpg","listing_id":"53001683","agent_phone":"020 8033 9529","price":1300000.0,"country_code":"gb","agent_address":"70 Marsh Wall, London","county":"London","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/53001683?utm_source=v1:7OOcASeVBADarhakZaAysSPpPE0tj76B&utm_medium=api","street_name":"No Street Name Specified","agent_name":"JOHNS&CO - Canary Wharf","num_recepts":1,"latitude":51.499985,"category":"Residential","outcode":"E14","property_type":"Flat","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/e0632bc95defa8087a4f633cb741d67e45d30a65.jpg"],"post_town":"London","first_published_date":{"__class__":"datetime","__value__":"2019-10-11T10:02:47"},"num_bedrooms":2,"price_modifier":"offers_over","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(505166).png","country":"England","description":"Direct views of Canary Wharf and the City skyline from this spectacular two bedroom apartment on the 48th floor of Wardian's East Tower.

Currently the layout has three bedroom areas with the main living space divide by stud wall and sealed doors. Opening the whole place up should be a straightforward affair.Beyond this, the generous ceiling height allows for an additional mezzanine area to play with.There are also two kitchens, clearly if this were a classic loft space, one would be removed and very easily. The main kitchen area located in the main living space sits next to wonderfully rustic Critall doors opening to that generous private terrace.We could wax lyrical for ages about what you could do but the best thing is to decide for yourself.The East side location of the building provides good transport links. The DLR is just minutes on foot at Langdon Park and Bromley By Bow Tube (District and Hammersmith & City) is also close by.

There is lift access to all floors.The apartment has a fantastic sense of volume owing to an exposed double-height pitched roof punctured with high-level windows that bathe the space in light. The main living areas are positioned on the lower level, whilst a generous mezzanine provides a dramatic space for the bedroom which has access to a south east-facing balcony. A half level up is a smaller contained space which can be used as a second bedroom, study or dressing room.Adjoining the main reception room is a cleverly designed conservatory that the current owner uses as a ceramics studio. The glazed roof maximises the intake of natural light and provides an additional space that can be contained from the otherwise open-plan living arrangement.The apartment is situated on the Limehouse Cut Canal in a vibrant area undergoing major redevelopment. Within ten minutes\u2019 walk are Chrisp Street Market, designed by Frederick Gibberd and built as part of the 1951 Festival of Britain, and the recently renovated Grade-ii listed Poplar Baths & leisure centre.

Because you only have to put down a deposit on the share you buy, you won't need to save as much for a deposit as you would if you were buying outright. ***Affordability and eligibility criteria applies.*Estimated mortgage payments assume an interest rate of 4.50% using a 10% deposit over 25 years on a repayment basis. The actual interest rate can vary. The monthly rent is calculated at 2.75% per annum of the value of the share that is not purchased.

Because you only have to put down a deposit on the share you buy, you won't need to save as much for a deposit as you would if you were buying outright. **Affordability and eligibility criteria applies.*Estimated mortgage payments assume an interest rate of 4.50% using a 10% deposit over 25 years on a repayment basis. The actual interest rate can vary. The monthly rent is calculated at 2.75% per annum of the value of the share that is not purchased. Service charge is only an estimate and may increase in future.***Images and CGIs are for illustrative purposes only.","num_bathrooms":2,"listing_status":"sale"},{"displayable_address":"Fairmont Avenue, London E14","last_published_date":{"__class__":"datetime","__value__":"2019-12-21T04:31:29"},"longitude":-0.004379,"image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/d0a441949a9790e37258ac3ff5f60c0ea4de84c1.jpg","listing_id":"53775618","agent_phone":"020 3478 3204","price":559950.0,"country_code":"gb","agent_address":"243 Lower Road, Surrey Quays","county":"London","details_url":"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/53775618?utm_source=v1:7OOcASeVBADarhakZaAysSPpPE0tj76B&utm_medium=api","street_name":"London","agent_name":"Hunters - Surrey Quays","num_recepts":0,"latitude":51.50629,"category":"Residential","outcode":"E14","property_type":"Flat","floor_plan":null,"post_town":"London","first_published_date":{"__class__":"datetime","__value__":"2019-12-21T04:30:26"},"num_bedrooms":2,"price_modifier":null,"agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(262224).png","country":"England","description":"Hunters are delighted to offer this lovely 2 bedroom apartment to the sales market in New Providence Wharf, Canary Wharf's most prestigious developments which includes a 24 hour concierge, a resident's gym, sauna, swimming pool and amenities.

The development is gated and benefits from a private balcony.East India Dock is one of Canary Wharfs most desirable locations due to the abundance of positives it offers, to list a few; this area has several riverside developments which means that there is access to some of Londons most scenic views and of course, for those looking to enjoy riverside strolls this is second to none. Due to the location being just outside of the centre of Canary Wharf, East India residents get an incredible combination of spacious, luxury apartments without paying the premium associated with the E14 area. There is also a local DLR station which gets to Canary Wharf in a matter of 7 minutes or into the City in roughly 20 minutes, this of course makes the area ideal for professionals that don't want lengthy travel to work or to live amongst the high rise buildings.Lease: 999 from 1998service charge: \u00a3214.pm (\u00a32568 per year)ground rent: \u00a3150 per yearhallway: - 16'11\" (5.16m) x 3'11\" (1.19m)living room/reception: - 17'11\" (5.46m) x 11'11\" (3.63m)kitchen: - 9'11\" (3.02m) x 6'11\" (2.11m)master bedroom: - 11'11\" (3.63m) x 9'11\" (3.02m)bedroom two: - 10'11\" (3.33m) x 6'11\" (2.11m)NoticePlease note we have not tested any apparatus, fixtures, fittings, or services.

The guide price may be subject to variation and interested parties are advised to make regular checks for variations and should be aware that the reserve price may be either below or above the quoted guide price.Prospective purchasers should also be aware that the eventual sale price may be above or below the guide level dependent upon competition, and should therefore not presume the guide to be indicative of the final expected sale price or the price the property is available at.When setting the guide price, the auctioneers have given consideration to the seller\u2019s instructions in respect of their indicated reserve price at the time of instruction. The reserve price, (the level below which the property will not be sold), remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer.

Because you only have to put down a deposit on the share you buy, you won't need to save as much for a deposit as you would if you were buying outright. **Affordability and eligibility criteria applies.*Estimated mortgage payments assume an interest rate of 4.50% using a 10% deposit over 25 years on a repayment basis. The actual interest rate can vary. The monthly rent is calculated at 2.75% per annum of the value of the share that is not purchased.
